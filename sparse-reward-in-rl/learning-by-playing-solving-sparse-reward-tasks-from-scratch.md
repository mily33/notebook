### Learning by Playing-Solving Sparse Reward Tasks from Scratch
**key idea:** active scheduling and execution of auxiliary policies allows the agent to efficiently explore its environment.

**Existing methods:**
- shaping reward
- curriculum learning
- sim-to-real
- learning from demonstrations
- learning with model guidance
- inverse RL

**Problem:**  all these methods bias the policy (suboptimal)
