Reinforcement Learning on Web Interfaces using Workflow-Guided Exploration (top 13%) -> solve the sparse rewards problem on web UI tasks using exploration guided by demonstrations.

TD or not TD: Analyzing the Role of Temporal Differencing in Deep Reinforcement Learning (top 9%) -> re-examine the role of TD in modern deep RL, using specially designed environments that each control for a specific factor that affects performance, such as reward sparsity, reward delay or the perceptual complexity of the task.
